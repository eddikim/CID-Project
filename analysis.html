            <h4>1. Background and Problem Statement</h4>
            <br>
            <p>	The background and problem statement serves the purpose of explaining the purpose 
                of our project and what we were aiming to accomplish in completing the project. </p>
            <br>
            <p>In the past 15 years, the Chinatown International District (CID) has faced significant upzoning, 
                challenging the well-being of its working-class community. Our goal was to develop an interactive 
                web map and analysis to preserve small business land ownership and advocate for land conservation in the CID. 
                We had three main objectives for this project. The first was to analyze notable changes in ownership trends over 
                time within the CID. The second was to analyze how land is utilized within the CID, and what the predominant land 
                use patterns are. The third objective was to analyze the ways in which corporate entities who own land within the 
                CID are impacting its local community and residents.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We wanted to take a deeper look at LLCs (Limited Liability Companys). This is because LLCs hide the true owner of 
                parcels which makes it hard to understand ownership and land use in an area. We also wanted to look at the occurrence 
                of $0 property transactions and analyze what this means and why this is occurring so frequently within the CID.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The following sections will discuss the systems used to create the web map and the process used to clean the data needed 
                for the creation of our map. We will also discuss our findings and any concluding statements and recommendations for 
                future research.</p>
        
            <h4>2. System Requirments</h4>
            <br>
            <p>As for the demands of our project, we needed an interactive web map that wouldimplement the parcel data for each building 
                within the CID, supplemented by details such as buyer name, date of purchase, and current use. Our data was acquired 
                through the King County assessors office which will be further elaborated on in Section 3 of our report. The first part 
                of our system requirements centered around QGIS which we used to generate raster tiles for our map. This was accomplished 
                through the QTiles plugin and, in doing so, provided a smoother navigation as well as faster loading times even when handling 
                our extensive dataset. MapBox was crucial in our research as it provided us with a foundation and stylistic options for our web 
                map. We integrated MapBox into our workflow by leveraging its vast array of mapping tools and services and employing its Application 
                Programming Interface (API). We were able to connect with MapBox's mapping services, such as tilesets, geocoding, and routing, 
                using the API key. The API key made it possible to retrieve and display our raster tiles generated from QGIS. We were able to select 
                a visually appealing and informative base map that suited our study aims, specifically by using MapBox's street style. After our 
                basemap was completed using QGIS and MapBox, we used R Studio in order to remove any inconsistencies, errors, and verify data quality 
                in order to cater the parcel data to our projects needs. Furthermore, VS Code was used as our development platform for creating our HTML 
                web map. Its code editor gave us an effective platform for authoring, revising, and debugging our web map code. We created the HTML code 
                that defined the structure, layout, and functionality of our web map using the features of VS Code. The relevant pieces, such as map 
                containers, buttons, and data overlays were created using HTML's markup language. Additionally, the use of GitHub was required to 
                effectively manage and publish our project. GitHub was critical to our project as it provided a centralized platform for collaborative 
                development and version control, allowing us to properly track the progress and contributions of each team member.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>3. Data Acquisition</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Parcel data necessary for our project was obtained through direct contact with the King County assessors office. Prior to this effort, 
                we attempted to acquire parcel data from the King County GIS Centers website. However, this proved to be futile as it did not include 
                any geodata that could be seamlessly implemented into our web map. Since the data we needed was not readily available through a public 
                open source, our team emailed the assessors office with a list of requirements, such as the timeframe (2008 - current) and detailed sales 
                data for each building. This was a strenuous process, especially given how long it took to receive all parts of our data, but it proved to 
                be effective and we were able to acquire everything we needed to complete our project.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>4.Data Analysis Stategy</h4>
            <br>
            <p>	In this section, we will discuss our approach to analyzing the data and how we went about working with such a large and complex dataset. 
                As requested, we intended to create a map to help visualize how each parcel has changed hands within the CID. However, this would only 
                offer methods of individual parcel analysis, so we also wanted to generate tables and charts that could help us understand overall trends 
                in ownership and land usage.</p>
            <br>
            <p>	Our process follows the chart below. After acquiring our Real Property Sales data and Parcel data, we merged and cleaned these datasets 
                together to create the dataset we would generate analysis from. Then, to look into the patterns of ownership in the CID, we created a map 
                to visualize changes in ownership for each parcel as well as four tables/charts for overall analysis of ownership trends..</p>
