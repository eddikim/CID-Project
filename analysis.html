            <h1>Project Description</h1>
        
            <p>Wildfires cause harm to the forestry and terrain of
                land, and with wildfire data, we can find where wildfires most occur and
                during which time in correlation to the health of the forests around
                where the wildfire starts. Using a geo-narrative to map our data
                would be the best way to represent our idea. We will use a
                geo-narrative with thematic layers to show the change in wildfires
                over time.</p>
        
            <p>Some examples of how this wildfire study can help others include people
                actively trying to make decisions about where they should live or
                move to, environmental health studies, the best locations for development, and for
                research into animal displacement.</p>

            <p>Contribution: Wrote up the README file in our projects GitHub Repository
                and helped to code the "About" page you are currently reading as well
                as creating a toggle function that we ultimatley ended up not using.
                A button element was used as an alternative.</p>
