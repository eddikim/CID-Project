                    <p>I am a 3rd year student at the University of Washington. I will be graduating in June 2024. I am pursuing a 
                        Bachelor of Arts in Geography with a focus in GIS and a minor in Real Estate. My interests include GIS and 
                        data base management and analysis. I am excited to announce that I will be interning with Seattle City Light 
                        as a Real Estate Database Intern for the next year.

                    <p>I am a 4th year student at the University of Washington graduating this spring (2023). I will
                    be finishing with a Bachelor of Arts in Geography with Data Science. I have a particular interest in the 
                    processes of map design and data visualization. As I transition from college into the "real world", I hope
                    this project serves as a monument of my academic achievements during my time at UW.

                    <p>I am a graduating senior student at the University of Washington. 
                        As a Geography Data Science major with a minor in Informatics at the University of Washington,
                        I have developed a strong foundation in computer programming, databases, and spatial analysis. 
                        Proficient in languages such as Java, R, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, I leverage data and 
                        various software to derive meaningful insights.
