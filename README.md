# [Who Owns The CID](https://eddikim.github.io/CID-Project/)

In the past 15 years, the Chinatown International District (CID) has faced significant upzoning, challenging the well-being of its working-class community. Our goal was to develop an interactive web map and analysis to preserve small business land ownership and advocate for land conservation in the CID. We had three main objectives for this project. The first was to analyze notable changes in ownership trends over time within the CID. The second was to analyze how land is utilized within the CID, and what the predominant land use patterns are. The third objective was to analyze the ways in which corporate entities who own land within the CID are impacting its local community and residents. 
	We wanted to take a deeper look at LLCs (Limited Liability Companyâ€™s). This is because LLCs hide the true owner of parcels which makes it hard to understand ownership and land use in an area. We also wanted to look at the occurrence of $0 property transactions and analyze what this means and why this is occurring so frequently within the CID.
	The following sections will discuss the systems used to create the web map and the process used to clean the data needed for the creation of our map. We will also discuss our findings and any concluding statements and recommendations for future research.
