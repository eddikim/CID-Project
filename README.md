# [Who Owns The CID](https://eddikim.github.io/CID-Project/)

In the past 15 years, the Chinatown International District (CID) has faced significant upzoning, challenging the well-being of its working-class community. Our goal was to develop an interactive web map and analysis to preserve small business land ownership and advocate for land conservation in the CID. We had three main objectives for this project. The first was to analyze notable changes in ownership trends over time within the CID. The second was to analyze how land is utilized within the CID, and what the predominant land use patterns are. The third objective was to analyze the ways in which corporate entities who own land within the CID are impacting its local community and residents.
